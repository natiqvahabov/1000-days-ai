### Other Resources
- Advice on applying machine learning: Slides from Andrew's lecture on getting machine learning algorithms to work in practice can be found [here](http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials/ML-advice.pdf).
- Projects: A list of last year's final projects can be found [here](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2017/index.html).
- Data: Here is the [UCI Machine learning repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), which contains a large collection of standard datasets for testing learning algorithms. If you want to see examples of recent work in machine learning, start by taking a look at the conferences [NIPS](https://nips.cc/)(all old NIPS papers are online) and ICML. Some other related conferences include UAI, AAAI, IJCAI.
