### Other Resources
- Advice on applying machine learning: Slides from Andrew's lecture on getting machine learning algorithms to work in practice can be found here.
- Projects: A list of last year's final projects can be found here.
- Data: Here is the UCI Machine learning repository, which contains a large collection of standard datasets for testing learning algorithms. If you want to see examples of recent work in machine learning, start by taking a look at the conferences NIPS(all old NIPS papers are online) and ICML. Some other related conferences include UAI, AAAI, IJCAI.
- Viewing PostScript and PDF files: Depending on the computer you are using, you may be able to download a PostScript viewer or PDF viewer for it if you don't already have one.
- Machine learning study guides tailored to CS 229 by Afshine Amidi and Shervine Amidi.
