# Hyperparameters and PSO

We have used several hyperparameters in both training and testing of our model with ANN, such as number of input neurons, number of hidden layers, output of hidden neurons, activation functions, batch_size, number of epochs and etc. In order to get high accuracy, we have to optimize these variables. In parameter tuning section, we saw how to use GridSearch technique to train model multiple times and chose best one. Another method to increase accuracy is decent and innovative approach which is called Partical Swarm Optimization. PSO is one of the Swarm Intelligence technique to mimic insects - such as bee, fish, ant and turn their natural social behaviours to algorithm. In real life, bees do Waggle dance in order to share area of flowers to others, ants build nests with colony in parallel, birds fly in flocks and etc. Nowadays, scientists try to learn their behaviour and apply them in mathematical problems. For example, Ant Colony Optimization was used to solve Travelling Salesman Problem. For ANN perspective, in some occasion, Gradient Descent is stucking in local minimum, in that case SI can be ideal to find global one. Table 1 illustrates the multiple SI algorithms.
